# Resources

## Raspberry Pi / Arduino resources

### Software

* [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home) great piece of software for board
  prototyping and development
* [Instrumentino](https://github.com/yoelk/Instrumentino) an open-source
  modular graphical user interface framework for controlling Arduino based
  experimental instruments


### Books/e-books

* [Programming Python for Arduino](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-Arduino-Pratik-Desai/dp/1783285931)
  a nice book for Python and Arduino enthusiasts
* [Getting started with sensors](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030119.do)


## Mobile App resources

Exploit the sensors and computing power of your smartphone, improve your instruments with a graphical interface displayed on your mobile and take them to another level of usability!

* *Build your App as you build a Puzzle!*

    You are a dummy in Mobile development, fine! If you are between 5 and 95 years-old, there is big chances you can already/still master Android Mobile App development with [*App Inventor*](http://appinventor.mit.edu/) ! 
    Originally developped at Google, now at MIT, *App Inventor* for Android lets you build an Android app with a puzzle-like interface in your browser.
    You will program by assembling "blocks" of code as Lego would have you program *Lego Mindstorm*.
    If not for you, this is still a great way to teach kids in a fun way about logic, how to cut a problem into subtasks, understand them well enough to translate them into bits.
    
    A whole new world is already waiting for you in your pocket!

* *Native Mobile App are dead! Build Mobile App as webpages*

    * [PhoneGap](https://build.phonegap.com/) is your friend!
    Develop a Mobile App as you would build a webpage (HTML, CSS, Javascript), and make it work for any OS (iPhone, Android, ...)
    
    * Other *[Hybrid Mobile App User Interface Frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_phone_web-based_application_framework)* exist
    Just pick the one you prefer. To name a few:
        * [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/)
        * [Intel XDK](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-xdk)
        * [JQuery Mobile](https://jquerymobile.com/)
        * ...
    
> A computer is very dumb, but obedient.  It does exactly what you tell it to do, which is not necessarily what you wanted.  Programming will help you learn the importance of clarity of expression.
